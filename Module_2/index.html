                            Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, 
                            consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,
                            cheese, and often various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature,
                            traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                        Burger is short for a hamburger. It's a fast food sandwich. That is a ground beef patty,
                        grilled, between a split seeded hamburger bun, often optionally also layered with lettuce, tomato, pickles,
                        onions, and a variety of sauces such as mayonnaise, mustard, or ketchup

                            The Indian vegetarian diet is known as lacto-vegetarian. It includes dairy, but
                            excludes eggs. Most vegetarians in India avoid eggs, which has spawned a large egg-free baking dessert 
                            repertoire. ... Grains, pulses, dairy, and vegetables are the main food groups in the Indian vegetarian diet.
